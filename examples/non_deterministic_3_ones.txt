; This non-deterministic Turing Machine accepts all binary words that contain
; 3 consecutive 1's

; First, it cycles through the word.
; If it encounters a 1, it might transition
; into the next state, or just keep cycling

q0 0 0 r q0
q0 1 1 r q0
q0 1 1 r q1
q0 _ _ * halt-reject

; From here on out, it must read the two remaining 1's
q1 1 1 r q2
q1 0 0 r halt-reject
q1 _ _ * halt-reject

q2 1 1 r halt-accept
q2 0 0 r halt-reject
q2 _ _ * halt-reject
